Operating Systems Coursework Archive (2024, 2nd Year)

This repository serves as a structured archive of the Operating Systems (OS) coursework conducted during the 2nd semester of 2024 at Dankook University.

It contains my submitted assignments, projects, and reports based on original materials provided via the official course repository:


📌 Original Course Repository (GitHub)

Each subdirectory contains:

Source code (if applicable)

README documentation for build & usage

Summary of implementation/analysis

Submission report (PDF/HWP format)


📚 Coursework Overview

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through these assignments and projects, I explored core OS concepts in practice, including:

Process & thread management

System calls (fork, exec, wait, setitimer, msgsnd, etc.)

Scheduling policies

Thread synchronization with mutexes and condition variables

Memory virtualization via paging and demand loading

Filesystem structure analysis (ext2)

Low-level debugging, Makefile-based build, profiling

Each directory contains a self-contained explanation of what was implemented, what challenges were faced, and what was learned.


📌 Notes
All source files and reports were authored individually unless otherwise specified.

Reports include both implementation analysis and performance observation.

Original problem statements and codebases are available from the official repository:
